Software engineering is a very broad and vast career path to go into. The many skills that you learn coding can land you in so many different areas from building simple websites to game design to defendning the country. I chose to go into software engineering because not only do i love to code, but also it means while I am learning the skills I need to prosper in my field, I can also decide on the many paths to take when I finish my studies. I cant wait to go through this flatiron journey!
