Upon the successful completion of my video for my CLI project, I realized I learned so much conducting this lab over the last two weeks! The projects haivng a much different process and no walkthroughs gave me a pretty warm welcome to the programming world!

As a fighting game player outside of Flatiron, I thought it would be cool to make a ruby app that had something to do with that. What I ended up going wiht is an app that takes the top 5 tournaments upcoming for Mortal Kombat 11 (my main game) and when prompted will give all of the other events that will take place at the tourney! People in the fighting game community usually go to compete for their main game but also some people would like to see the other events that takes place as well and even go to compete for multiple games!

I struggled alot with the scraping on my application. The proccess of scraping can be really easy or difficult it all depends upon how nice the website looks in the HTML document. In my case I was not too fortunate. I originally wanted to pull the date location and events, but with the way the website was and personal life along with the deadline, I couldnt make that come true just yet but I do plan to work on it some more!

This project I feel was a test to see if I was really ready to further myself into this wonderful field, and I am. I am surely enough ready for the future challenges that will come my way in this flatiron journey. Thank you for taking the time to read my blog, until next time.

Sincerely,
                   William West
