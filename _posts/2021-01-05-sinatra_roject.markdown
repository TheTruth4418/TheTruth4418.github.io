So far in my flatiron journey, things have been going pretty smooth! Im grasping the concepts along the way pretty fast and I do feel like I am very knowledgeable about sinatra thus far! The only thing that was different this time around was my work life balance being tipped off the scale by ALOT. My job schedueled me more hours thus making it hard to even complete my project, however I overcame that and I did end up getting it done! I like how stgrong sinatra is and especially how dynamic you can make applications from it. It also is helping me branch my creativity out alot since I have the power to do more. Rails here I come!
